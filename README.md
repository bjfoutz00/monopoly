# Monopoly
This is a playable text-based monopoly game implementing the basic rules of classic Monopoly. It comes with an AI player that uses max-tree searching to play rationally and competitively.

To run, type `python board.py X Y`, where X is the total number of players (up to 9) you would like to play in the game, and Y is the number of human players (the rest will be ai players)
You will notice the printing is staggered by 0.5 seconds. To turn on fast printing, run the program with the `-f` or `--fast` flag.
